Exercise 2

1. Amazon Dynamo, 

N - The number of copies of data to be replicated
W - The number of votes necessary to confirm a write has effectively completed
R - The number of votes necessary to confirm the data read is the correct version
Q - The number of partitions/hash buckets

N is typically an odd integer to defeat ties in voting
To achieve a "quorum-like" system, R + W > N, meaning a majority of votes is required for acceptance rather than a plurality.
